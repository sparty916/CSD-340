                    <h3>Who is Pj?</h3>
                    <p>Pj was born Patrick 'Jeremy' Ellis and was raised in Northwest Indiana, Hammond to be exact. Growing up he had quite the 
                    interest in the theatrics and spent most of his time performing on the stage in school productions or in local area theater guilds.  
                    Pj never really cared for the weather in the Northern Midwest, so when he finally had a chance to get out... He took it!</p>
                    <p>Pj moved to Orlando Florida to get away from the snow and cold and got a job performing at Walt Disney World Resort.
                    He got an amazing opportunity to travel the world by landing a cruiseline contract as a production show dancer with Celebrity
                    Cruiseline, and did that for about 4 years.</p>
                    <p>During the 2020 shut down, Pj decided to leave Disney World to pursue some other opportunities, and worked as a Tour Guide 
                    for an up and coming Tour Company, Real Florida Adventures. Eventually, he decided to come back to Disney and is now forging 
                    a new path with his career.</p>

                            <h3>Camping</h3>                        
                            <p>I have always been an outdoorsy adventurous guy, so camping and hiking have always been one of my favorite  types of 
                            activities to do in my spare time, or as a vacation. My favorite spot to go camping and hiking as been in Yosemite National 
                            Park out in California. Hiking up to the top of Half Dome, which round-trip is an 18 mile hike, was an awesome experience. 
                            Here you can see me with my birthday present to myself, my new tent.  It has made a great new addition to my camping supplies.</p>

                            <p>Being artistic and creative is one of the many ways I have been able to express myself through out the years. A great 
                            way to keep my hands busy is by designing and building little knick-knacks out of scraps.  During the 2020 shut down, I 
                            made 101 hand crafted Harry Potter inspired wands and showcased them on the wall in my hallway.</p>

                            <p>When the time comes for me to try and relieve some stress, I enjoy to go running as a way to clear my head.  It has been a 
                            great way to shut out the noise of the world for a brief time, and not have to worry about what is currently stressing me out. 
                            The only thing I have to worry about where I can find more water!  My most recent run was the WDW Marathon in January of 2023.  
                            It took me a total of 7 hours, but it was worth it to get that awesome medal and those limited edition Mickey Ears.</p>
