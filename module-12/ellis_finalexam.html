                    <p>ark comes from a close-knit family consisting his mother, 
                    Patti, older sister, Holly, and younger brother, Bobby.  Growing up as the middle child in Texas wasnâ€™t 
                    easy, but thanks to tremendous care and support from his grandmother, everything turned out great, not 
                    just for Mark, but for them all.  Both of his siblings are happily married with healthy kids, making 
                    Mark an uncle to his triplet nephews, Ryder, Rhett, and Rory, from his sister, and then from his brother 
                    he got his niece, Amelia.</p>

                            <p>I have always been an outdoorsy adventurous guy, so camping and hiking have always been one of my favorite 
                            types of activities to do in my spare time, or as a vacation.</p>

                            <p>Being artistic and creative is one of the many ways I have been able to express myself through out the years.  Building
                            and designing fun little knick-knacks out of scraps is a great way to keep my hands busy.  During the 2020 shut down, I made
                            101 hand crafted Harry Potter inspired wands of various themes and designs.</p>

                            <p>When the time comes for me to relieve some stress, I enjoy running as a way to clear my head.  It is a great way to shut out
                            the world for a brief time, and not have to worry about what is stressing me out.  I only have to worry about where I can find 
                            more water!</p>
